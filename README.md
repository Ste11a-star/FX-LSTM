# FX-LSTM
FX Analysis using LSTM
This project looks at GBP and AUD. We attempt to craft out some strategies and run them through a LSTM classification model to see if new insights can be gained.
The data set is from 2020 and consists of 1 minute data
As the initial model didnt work well, we ran 2 more alternative LSTM models - a regressor and a forwrad step regressor
